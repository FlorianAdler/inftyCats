	\begin{numpar}[The aim of these notes.]

	\end{numpar}
	
	\begin{numpar}[Model independence and notation.]\label{par:ModelIndependenceIntro}
		The model for $\infty$-categories we use in these notes will be \emph{quasi-categories}. But there are many other approaches to $\infty$-categories, like \emph{topologically} or \emph{Kan-enriched categories}, \emph{complete Segal spaces}, \emph{$1$-complicial sets}, \ldots\ Of course, these approaches should all be equivalent, but it's usually a non-trivial task to tranfer a result proven in one model into another model. A general theory of model independence that allows for such non-trivial transfers has been developed by Emily Riehl and Dominic Verity \cite{RiehlVerity}.
		
		In these notes, we take a somewhat different approach towards a model-independent theory. We will, or at least we would, in an ideal version of these notes, proceed in the following steps:
		\begin{alphanumerate}
			\item First, we'll set up the framework of quasi-categories, by any means necessary.\label{enum:SetupQuasicategories}
			\item After that, we'll identify a few key model-independent statements and prove (or black box) them in the model of quasi-categories.\label{enum:KeyStatements}
			\item Finally, all further proofs will be done in a model-independent fashion.\label{enum:AllProofsModelIndependent}
		\end{alphanumerate}
		So, at least in an ideal world, if you prefer a different model of quasi-categories, you'll probably know how to do steps~\cref{enum:SetupQuasicategories} and~\cref{enum:KeyStatements} in your model, and then everything from step~\cref{enum:AllProofsModelIndependent} will work in your model too.
		
		In reality, these notes don't quite live up to that ideal, but I dare say we come somewhat close. In \crefrange{sec:SimplicialSets}{sec:Straightening}, we'll sketch how to get the theory of quasi-categories off the ground. This corresponds to steps~\cref{enum:SetupQuasicategories} and~\cref{enum:KeyStatements} above, with most of \cref{enum:KeyStatements} happening in \cref{sec:JoyalLifting} and \cref{sec:Straightening}. Everything from \cref{sec:InftyCategoryTheory} onward mostly falls within step~\cref{enum:AllProofsModelIndependent}. I write \enquote{mostly} because, unfortunately, there are still a few non-model-independent arguments scattered throughout the text, the worst offender probably being our treatment of cardinality bounds and filteredness in \cref{subsec:Presentable}. I could, of course, tautologically claim that every non-model-independent proof still belongs to step~\cref{enum:KeyStatements}, but that would be a poor excuse for my inability to come up with better arguments.
		
		The transition to (mostly) model-independent arguments will be reflected in a change of terminology: Throughout \crefrange{sec:SimplicialSets}{sec:Straightening}, we'll use the term  \emph{quasi-category}, we'll write $\F(\Cc,\Dd)$ for the mapping object in simplicial sets and we'll always write $\N(\Ee)$ to emphasise that an ordinary category $\Ee$ can be turned into a quasi-category via the nerve construction. Starting from \cref{sec:InftyCategoryTheory}, we'll simply say \emph{$\infty$-category}, write $\Fun(\Cc,\Dd)$, and consider every ordinary category $\Ee$ implicitly as an $\infty$-category, suppressing $\N$ everywhere. Only when we're using non-model-independent arguments, we'll switch back to the old terminology, to emphasise that what we're doing is morally questionable.

	\begin{thm}\label{thm:DRIsModulesOverHR}
		The functor $\H\colon \Dd(\IZ)\rightarrow \cat{Sp}$ can be equipped with a symmetric monoidal structure and induces equivalences
		\begin{equation*}
			\H\colon \Dd(R)\overset{\simeq}{\longrightarrow} \cat{LMod}_{\H R}(\cat{Sp})
		\end{equation*}
		for every ordinary ring $R$. If $R$ is commutative, then $\cat{LMod}_{\H R}(\cat{Sp})$ admits a canonical symmetric monoidal structure and the above equivalence can be made strictly monoidal if we equip $\Dd(R)$ with the symmetric monoidal structure induced by $-\lotimes_R-$.\hfill$\blacksquare$
	\end{thm}
	\begin{cor}\label{cor:Homology}
		If $X\in\cat{An}$ is an anima, then the unreduced and reduced homology and cohomology of $X$ with coefficients in an abelian group $A$ are given by
		\begin{align*}
			\H_*(X,A)&\cong \pi_*\lef(\IS[X]\otimes\H A\righ)\,,& \widetilde{\H}_*\left(X,A\right)&\cong \pi_*\Bigl(\fib\lef(\IS[X]\rightarrow \IS[*]\righ)\otimes\H A\Bigr)\,,\\
			\H^*(X,A)&\cong \pi_{-*}\hom_\IS\lef(\IS[X],\H A\righ)\,,& \widetilde{\H}^*\left(X,A\right)&\cong \pi_{-*}\hom_\IS\Bigl(\fib\lef(\IS[X]\rightarrow \IS[*]\righ),\H A\Bigr)\,.
